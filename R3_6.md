Thank you for reviewing our work and providing thoughtful comments **C1, C2, C3.** We hope that the following discussion will allow you to reassess the paper.

**C1.** As outlined in the *Introduction*, our research questions are shaped by emerging use cases that imply decision-making by LLM-based agents. Even if LLMs are not enabled with access to various tools, their expressed *"opinions"* on different behaviors –– clearly dependent on the way they were prompted –– might lead to dramatic real-life implications (e.g. resonant Character.ai cases). 

We do recognize the *"fundamental difference between LLMs and humans in "experiencing" moral dilemmas"* you have fairly outlined (see *Limitations*), but still pose the initial hypothesis of behavioral alignment due to the success in *"Generating texts simulating a personality type"*, hinting at the presence of a good internal model of what the personality entails. The discussion provided in the paper helps to draw, for the first time, a clear line between personality-reflecting texts and the behaviors / active choices in the context of LLMs' personality assessment. To this end, the negative results we observed set the limits of applicability of personality prompting.

**C2.** Building on the above, we fully agree with the distinction you make, in fact, it is central to our paper. We do not challenge in any way the success of text-based personality simulation, but instead demonstrate that it does not extend to behavior: we will emphasize that in the final version. Given the societal importance of aligning the behavior of LLM-based agents, we hope that our work will lead to the development of novel methods improving this alignment.

**C3.** Regarding ME set-up, as noted in the paper, we closely followed Aher et. al (2023) apart from "(5) Stop?" and "(6) obey" blocks. We do acknowledge the importance of the paper being self-contained and will present all the prompts we used in the *Appendix* of the final version. 

Thank you for pointing out the missing citation (Frisch et.al.), we will add it to the final version as well.
