Thank you for taking the time to review our work and for voicing your concerns **C1, C2, C3.** We hope that our clarifications will allow you to reassess the paper.

**C1.** As you correctly observe, the literature review is focused on 14 works (with 7 additional sources provided in the footnotes), which we attribute to the novelty of our research: while behavioural experiments have previously been reproduced with LLMs (Aher et.al.) and personality-prompted LLMs have been assessed through simple psychological tests and the essays they generate (Serapio-Garcıa et al.), we are the first to quantitatively assess how well personality-prompted LLMs align in terms of the decisive actions they take. To this end, there is no prior art we could cite. Regarding the ME and UG background, we cited both the original studies and the only two works we found that provide a comprehensive statistical analysis of the relationship between participants' BIG-5 traits and their performance in UG and ME. 

**C2.** As we emphasize in the *Related work* section, several studies have already demonstrated an *understanding of the personality traits themselves*. To strengthen this claim, we administer an IPIP-NEO-300 questionnaire to the exact personality-prompted models we use and observe a clear dependence of the manifested intensity of the trait (1-5 scale; see Serapio-Garcıa et al. for the assessment methodology) on the prompted one (1-9 scale) for each model. Below are the results for GPT-4o; we will add these for each model to the *Supplementary* of the final version.

**C3** We acknowledge the importance of the paper being self-contained. Since we did not focus solely on ME and had to adhere to the length limit, we omitted detailed explanations of some of the ME steps. We will provide these in the *Appendix* of the final version.
